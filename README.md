<h2>What is Server-Sent-Events ? </h2>
With server-sent events, it's possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time, by pushing messages to the web page. This way you do not need to hit API again and again.</br>
It helps in one way communication, and is also used for things like broadcasting live score and stuff like that.
